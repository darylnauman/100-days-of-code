# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 11, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed a few more exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've been reading a book about HTML & CSS over the last few weeks on and off. Recently I started the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) by freeCodeCamp. This is the first time I've done a Gitentry here about it as I've started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 2: May 12, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (freeCodeCamp) and began working on "Introduction to Basic CSS". Learned about changing font colour, size, style, etc., as well as, some adjustments to images.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about what I learned today. I will need to figure out how to grab the correct info to use Google Fonts.


### Day 3: May 13, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 5 of "HTML&CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett during commute home and learned useful info on images, e.g., JPEGs vs. GIFs. Completed a few sessions on freeCodeCamp about borders, rounded corners, and background colors.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty tired from work today and not a lot of sleep last night. A few simple but neat concepts.

### Day 4: May 14, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through several freeCodeCamp sessions within Basic CSS. The main focus was on margins and padding of elements.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about the concepts today. I'll need to continue to use them to get used to them more.

### Day 5: May 15, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started today learning about CSS colour overriding --> class is overridden by ID attributes, ID attributes are overridden by inline style. Next, I learned about hex codes and RGB values for colours. Finally, I finished up "Basic CSS" with CSS variables & media query.

**Thoughts**: Today was good as I wasn't too tired from the day at work and it was fun to play with the colours and also pleased to have completed "Basic CSS".

### Day 6: May 16, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read more of "HTML&CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett on my way home. Then worked through some Applied Visual Design lessons.

**Thoughts**: Long day at work although interesting as I participated in IT Day. Eyes are tired so did some reading and getting close to calling it a night.

### Day 7: May 17, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through Applied Visual Design lessons including box-shadow, opacity, font-weight, font-size, and some CSS offsets.

**Thoughts**: I had the day off from work today and while I had a few things to do ealier in the day, I was able to work through lessons before dinner which was great.

### Day 8: May 18, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about colors within CSS and how to use an image as a background. Played around with linear-gradient, the transform property and before/after selectors.

**Thoughts**: Had some fun today playing with colors and also tried a few things on my own using hover.

### Day 9: May 19, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about CSS keyframes and animation properties, such as, animation-timing-function. Actually, I finished within Applied Visual Design the "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges"!

**Thoughts**: Excited to have finished the "Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges" but recognize I'll need more practice for the concepts to really stick.

### Day 10: May 20, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through several of the Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges sections. Learned about alt text, landmarks (header, footer, nav, etc.), audio controls, making some content only available for screen readers, fieldset element, and color considerations.

**Thoughts**: Remember to make your websites accessible!

### Day 11: May 21, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Read some of "HTML&CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett about forms on the ride home as I left work a bit late. Continued to work through accessibility challenges then moved on to basic responsive web design principles. 

**Thoughts**: More practice will be key but it was still good to learn how to adjust images and other aspects of a site based on screen size for example.

### Day 12: May 22, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read "HTML&CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett again since it was another later night at work. A few light bulb moments around "label for" and form controls in general. As for freeCodeCamp - I learned about CSS flexbox. 

**Thoughts**: Concepts are making sense and I'm looking forward to the challenge of coding all aspects of a page, i.e., not simply the small tweaks and additions for the concept being taught in the small lesson although those are important.

### Day 13: May 23, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the align-items property and how to use properties: flex-shrink, flex-grow, flex-wrap, and order. Next up was a few CSS grid exercises.

**Thoughts**: Exercises are making sense overall but it will be helpful to go through the projects and Jon Duckett's book for the concepts to really stick.

### Day 14: May 24, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I decided to take a break from @freeCodeCamp today & started a @lynda course: CSS Essentials Training 1. I think learning concepts through another means will help solidify them in my mind especially before trying to solve more challenging projects. Most of today involved watching the first few videos, setting up the exercise files, and starting the project files.

**Thoughts**: The videos with exercise files I believe will be a good way to learn the material.

### Day 15: May 25, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through CSS Essential Training 1 and while some concepts were new even those that I already had learned through other training I now feel like I understand them better. Setup a @jsfiddle account too! #100DaysOfCode Plus: Type, class, id selectors and pseudo-class selectors (e.g., active, hover, focus).

**Thoughts**: Enjoyed setting up a JSFiddle account and practicing CSS within it. 

### Day 16: May 26, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Day 16: Learned about RGB, hex, and color values plus how selectors relate, as well as, what takes priority (e.g., class vs id). Gained more appreciation about font selection and a better understanding how to actually use Google fonts website. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts**: Glad to have learned how to select Google fonts from the website.


### Day 17: May 27, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Day 17: Continued to learn about typography including how to pull info from the Google Fonts website (e.g., code for HTML files, CSS rules) and adjust text (e.g., line-height, font-size). Gained a better understanding of block vs. inline and the box model. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts**: Worked on some of this on the bus ride home -- not comfortable trying to balance my iPad and computer but I was able to keep up with the challenge and not do all of my coding later into the evening once home.

### Day 18: May 28, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More work on CSS layouts - margins, padding, spacing. Straining on the bus to setup iPad and laptop might not be the best for learning and posture...  #100DaysOfCode.

**Thoughts**: My neck is in pain which might be a result in part of trying to watch Lynda.com videos and code on my laptop while on the bus.
