# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 11, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed a few more exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've been reading a book about HTML & CSS over the last few weeks on and off. Recently I started the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) by freeCodeCamp. This is the first time I've done a Gitentry here about it as I've started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 2: May 12, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (freeCodeCamp) and began working on "Introduction to Basic CSS". Learned about changing font colour, size, style, etc., as well as, some adjustments to images.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about what I learned today. I will need to figure out how to grab the correct info to use Google Fonts.


### Day 3: May 13, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 5 of HTML&CSS: design and build websites by Jon Duckett during my commute home.</br> Feeling pretty tired so only completed a few sessions on freeCodeCamp. [text].

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty tired from work today and not a lot of sleep last night.
