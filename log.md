# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 11, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed a few more exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I've been reading a book about HTML & CSS over the last few weeks on and off. Recently I started the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) by freeCodeCamp. This is the first time I've done a Gitentry here about it as I've started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

### Day 2: May 12, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (freeCodeCamp) and began working on "Introduction to Basic CSS". Learned about changing font colour, size, style, etc., as well as, some adjustments to images.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about what I learned today. I will need to figure out how to grab the correct info to use Google Fonts.


### Day 3: May 13, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Read chapter 5 of "HTML&CSS: design and build websites" by Jon Duckett during commute home and learned useful info on images, e.g., JPEGs vs. GIFs. Completed a few sessions on freeCodeCamp about borders, rounded corners, and background colors.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty tired from work today and not a lot of sleep last night. A few simple but neat concepts.

### Day 4: May 14, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through several freeCodeCamp sessions within Basic CSS. The main focus was on margins and padding of elements.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good about the concepts today. I'll need to continue to use them to get used to them more.

### Day 5: May 15, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started today learning about CSS colour overriding --> class is overridden by ID attributes, ID attributes are overridden by inline style. Next, I learned about hex codes and RGB values for colours. Finally, I finished up "Basic CSS" with CSS variables & media query.

**Thoughts**: Today was good as I wasn't too tired from the day at work and it was fun to play with the colours and also pleased to have completed "Basic CSS".
