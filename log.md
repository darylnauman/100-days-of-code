# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 11, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed a few more exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've been reading a book about HTML & CSS. Recently I started the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) by freeCodeCamp and this is the first time I've done an entry here about it as I've started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
